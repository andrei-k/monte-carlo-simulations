# Monte Carlo Simulations

A Monte Carlo simulation works by repeating a calculation using a large number of random samples and generating an approximate result. For example, it's possible to use this method to calculate the value of Ï€ by generating many random points in a square and counting how many fall within the circle. Another simple example is calculating the probability of a coin landing heads. In both cases, the larger the sample size, the more accurate the result will be.
